# Magic Tricks: Demystifying IPython Magics (Infosec Jupyterthon 2022)

This project contains supporting materials for a presentation at the 2022 [Infosec Jupyterthon](https://infosecjupyterthon.com/) conference title **Magic Tricks: Demystifying IPython Magics**.

## Abstract

> Jupyter notebooks support a feature called "magic commands" (aka "IPython magics") that use a special syntax (%) for calling utility functions. This talk explains how magics work and how to write custom magics that make security analysis and research tasks more efficient. The live demo is a proof-of-concept magic command that integrates the Azure CLI with `pandas` for convenient evidence collection and analysis in Jupyter notebooks.
